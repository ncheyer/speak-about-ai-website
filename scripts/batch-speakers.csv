In this pioneering role, he has facilitated transformative keynotes and workshops by booking renowned speakers including Google executives, Stanford researchers, and startup co-founders for prestigious organizations such as Juniper Networks, WebMD Ignite, Rio Innovation Week, ST Engineering, and the South Korean Government.
Growing up in Silicon Valley as the son of Adam Cheyer, co-founder and CTO of Siri, Noah gained early exposure to the AI revolution from a unique vantage point. This insider perspective, combined with launching an agency from scratch using AI, enables him to bridge the gap between complex AI capabilities and practical business applications in a way that resonates with non-technical audiences.
As the author of ""Do More With Less Using AI,"" an AI newsletter for event professionals, Noah’s mission is to translate cutting-edge AI developments into immediately actionable solutions. His AI Readiness Framework, developed through in-depth conversations with over 100 event and AI industry leaders, provides organizations with a clear methodology for identifying where AI delivers real ROI versus where human expertise remains irreplaceable.
Noah's approach stands out for its practicality and results-oriented focus. Rather than promoting AI for AI's sake, he has created a suite of custom tools, including the Event Timeline Generator, Attendee Persona Analyzer, and Strategic CMO Consultant, that demonstrably cut routine tasks by 50-70% while elevating strategic thinking (without costing a cent). His workshops and keynotes feature live demonstrations, real-world case studies, and hands-on tool building, ensuring participants leave with functioning solutions rather than just theoretical knowledge.
Through his work at Speak About AI, Noah has gained unique insights into how the world's leading organizations are successfully implementing AI, from Fortune 1000 companies transforming their operations to innovative startups disrupting entire industries. This broad exposure, combined with his commitment to practical implementation over hype, has made him a sought-after speaker and consultant for organizations ready to move beyond AI curiosity to actual transformation.
Noah's mission is simple: democratize access to AI tools and knowledge so that professionals in any industry can do more of the work that matters most while automating the rest.
