# Admin Portal Setup Guide for Production

## âœ… Local Testing Confirmed Working
The admin login works perfectly locally with these credentials:
- Email: `human@speakabout.ai`
- Password: `SpeakAboutAI2025!`

## ðŸš¨ Production Setup Required

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
Navigate to: https://vercel.com â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

### Step 2: Add These EXACT Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT**: Copy these values EXACTLY as shown, including all characters:

```
ADMIN_EMAIL
```
Value:
```
human@speakabout.ai
```

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
```
Value:
```

```

```
JWT_SECRET
```
Value:
```

```

### Step 3: Important Notes
1. **DO NOT** include quotes around the values in Vercel
2. **DO NOT** add any extra spaces before or after the values
3. Make sure to select **Production** environment when adding the variables
4. The password hash should be one long string without any line breaks

### Step 4: Redeploy
After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to the Deployments tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the three dots menu â†’ Redeploy
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache" â†’ Redeploy

### Step 5: Test Login
1. Go to: https://speakabout.ai/admin
2. Enter email: `human@speakabout.ai`
3. Enter password: `SpeakAboutAI2025!`
4. Click Login

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "Authentication service unavailable"
- The `ADMIN_EMAIL` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` environment variable is missing in Vercel

### If you see "Authentication service configuration error"  
- The `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is missing in Vercel

### If you see "Invalid credentials"
- Double-check that the email is exactly: `human@speakabout.ai`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the environment variables
- The password hash might have been copied incorrectly

### To Verify Environment Variables Are Set
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. You should see all three variables listed for Production
3. Click the eye icon to view each value and verify it matches above

### Debug Endpoint (Development Only)
Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/debug-auth
This will show if environment variables are properly loaded.

## Alternative: Set Your Own Password

If you want to use a different password:

1. Run locally:
```bash
node scripts/test-admin-login.mjs "YourCustomPassword123"
```

2. Copy the generated hash
3. Update `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in Vercel with the new hash
4. Redeploy the application

## Security Notes
- The JWT_SECRET should remain secret and never be shared
- Change the admin password regularly
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords
