    <h3>2. Taxation</h3>
    <p>The Speaker agrees to act as an independent contractor under the terms of this agreement and assumes all responsibility for Social Security, State, and Federal Income Tax, etc., as governed by the laws of the federal government of the United States and the Speaker's state of residence. The Client is not responsible for any additional expenses or costs.</p>

    <h3>3. Deposit and Payment</h3>
    <p>A <strong>50% Deposit</strong> is due at the time of execution/signing of this agreement. The 50% Balance Payment is due net-30 days from the Client's receipt of invoice by the Agent. If this contract is executed within 45 days of the event, the client will receive one invoice combining the deposit and balance. This agreement is entered into in good faith by all parties. However, cancellation by the client shall make the client liable for the amount of the 50% deposit. If the contract is canceled by the Speaker, the Speaker and the Agent will refund all payments made.</p>

    <h3>4. Permission to Photograph and Record</h3>
    <p>Any use of the Speaker's name, likeness, presentation content, or Recordings (as that term is defined in this section) for commercial purposes (and the section below marked "Permissible Use" is not considered to be commercial purposes) is expressly prohibited. No Trademark license is granted.</p>

The Client may, without further fee or payment, use the Speaker's name and likeness for up to 12 months after the talk is delivered in marketing and promotion, but that does not suggest Speaker affiliation or endorsement.</p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">For example, the Client may share short snippets (up to 3-minute clips) from or about the event and talk that reference or include the Speaker. However, those snippets may not suggest endorsement by the speaker of the Client's products or the Client itself. The Recording in its entirety may be shared internally and  via a private link for the 12 months after the initial airing date of Saturday, March 15, 2025. The Client agrees that they will not use the Recording for the purpose of training artificial intelligence models or digital twins of the Speaker.</p>
