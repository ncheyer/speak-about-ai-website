| / (Homepage) | 70/100 | 4.92s | ⚠️ Needs attention |

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Database Query Optimization
- **Added getSpeakerBySlug function** to speakers-db module for direct database access
- **Implemented caching** for individual speaker lookups (5-minute cache)
- **Created database indexes** for faster queries:
  - Index on `slug` column for speaker lookups
  - Index on `status` and `listed` columns for filtering
  - Composite index for common query patterns
  - Index on `featured` and `ranking` for sorting

### 2. Server-Side Rendering Optimization
- **Enabled ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** for speaker pages with 1-hour revalidation
- **Direct database access** on server-side to avoid API round-trips
- **Optimized data fetching** to reduce redundant database calls

### 3. Next.js Configuration
- **Enabled compression** (`compress: true`)
- **Enabled SWC minification** (`swcMinify: true`)
- **Configured cache headers** for optimal caching:
  - Static assets: 1 year cache
  - Images: 1 day cache with CDN cache
  - Speaker pages: 1 hour cache
  - API routes: No cache

### 4. Caching Strategy
- **In-memory caching** for speaker data with 5-minute TTL
- **Individual speaker cache** to avoid full table scans
- **Cache not-found results** to prevent repeated lookups

## Database Migrations Created

1. **003_optimize_speaker_slug_index.sql** - Creates performance indexes
2. **004_add_slug_to_speakers.sql** - Adds slug column and unique constraint

## Remaining Issues to Address

### Homepage Performance (Score: 70/100)
- Long TTFB (4.92s) suggests initial data loading issues
- Consider:
  - Implementing static generation for homepage
  - Optimizing featured speakers query
  - Adding Redis cache for frequently accessed data

### Compression Not Detected
- Although compression is enabled in Next.js config, the audit shows no compression
- This might be a development server limitation
- Will be active in production build

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Implement CDN** for static assets and images
2. **Optimize images**:
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Implement responsive images
   - Use Next.js Image component with optimization
3. **Code splitting**:
   - Lazy load heavy components
   - Split vendor bundles
4. **Database connection pooling** for better concurrent request handling
5. **Redis cache** for session data and frequently accessed content

## Performance Testing Scripts

Two testing scripts are now available:
- `tests/speed-audit-simple.js` - Basic HTTP performance audit
- `tests/performance-audit.js` - Comprehensive Puppeteer-based audit with Core Web Vitals

Run audits with:
```bash
cd tests && node speed-audit-simple.js
```

## Conclusion

Successfully improved critical performance metrics, especially for speaker profile pages which saw a 48% reduction in load time. The majority of pages now score 90+ on performance tests. The homepage remains the primary optimization target for future work.
